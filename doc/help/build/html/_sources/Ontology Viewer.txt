Ontology Viewer
===============

The ontology viewer provides a visual interface to the variables defined in the data spreadsheets of the project. Each variable is annotated and provides a detailed explanation about its encoding.

A link is provided to a textual representation of the data dictionary used in the ontology.

A second link opens a textual interface to the annotation engine used to define the structure of the linkage between dictionary terms.
