Overview Application
====================

The overview application provides an overview of the distribution of key variables of a project. For example the overview application might display the distribution of ages in a subject population.

The overview application uses active histograms that are linked with each other. A selection done by mouse in one histogram will select a sub-set of subjects. Other histograms in the same view will show the distribution of the corresponding subset of subjects.

The categories of overviews available needs to be setup system wide by the site adminitrator for each project.
