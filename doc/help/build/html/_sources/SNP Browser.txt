SNP Browser
===========

The browser for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is a special application for projects that provide such information. It displays a list with several thousand SNP values and can be used to search for SNPs that fall into a basepair range defined by gene name. The browser contains a database with 80,000 gene names.
