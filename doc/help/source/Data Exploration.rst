Data Exploration Application
============================

This application provides a front-end to the statistical analysis available for cross-sectional analysis of a project.

In order to perform an analysis it is best to start with a list of variables of interest which can be obtained from the ontology viewer of this portal. Enter the variables of interest in the user interface of the Data Exploration page and press the "Compute ROI Model" button to perform an analysis for your selected region of interest.

The scatter plot allows the user to inspect the image data linked to each point. Further down the page key characteristics of the model are displayed together with a summary providing detailed information about the significance of each model variable.
